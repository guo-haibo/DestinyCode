The inspiration of this project comes from the crop circle, which is suspected to be alien technology and super science. It should be realized through hard research and development. The original intention of this project is to develop a coding language for human beings to become a united interstellar race. There is an old saying in China: if you don't know the fate, you can't be a gentleman. The purpose and mission of this project is to make people become the common destiny of human beings from the subconscious A member of the body.


Analysis of the psychological principle of this Code:


There is an interesting example to illustrate the influence of graphics on people's subconscious. When a person burps, he or she can stop burping by holding a chopstick upright in front of the burping person. In fact, this is the shape of chopsticks on the subconscious, Fate code and this is the same truth, a concentric circle placed in front of your eyes, will have an impact on the subconscious concentric.

The advantages of this code type are introduced


The design of the coding concentric circle has the function of adjusting human emotions, has a positive impact on the cooperation and subconsciousness, and has a positive impact on the unity of human beings.


Concentric circles are sacred geometric structures. With the language guidance of destiny code naming, the process of people viewing the coding through the camera is the process of subconscious action. The meaning of a thing or a person's name determines its attributes. The name of destiny code is to let people call it open, let people know the fate in their hearts, and have the same heart.


The mathematical principle of this code is as follows


This code adopts Unicode 16 encoding, 16 bit binary represents one character, concentric circles from inside to outside each circle represents a specified number of characters, black arc represents binary 1, light gray arc represents binary 0, the first circle is divided into 16 parts to represent 1 character, the second circle is divided into 32 parts to represent 2 characters, and so on. At most 15 circles, 120 characters, less than one circle at the end, fill the outer circle with a space.


Source code introduction:


The project is divided into three versions: Web, IOS and Android. At present, the first version of encoding and decoding of web version has been completed with C ා. Net language, which completes the online encoding image generation function and the decoding function of the original encoding image. If you need to generate coding graphics, you can visit the website, please visit[destinycode](http://nianqing.com)，
The website adopts utf16 encoding type, supports both Chinese and English languages, and supports all language characters. Project coding and decoding technology involves opencv computer vision technology.

Project requirements:


IOS and Android need more people to develop at present. What we need to do is the encoding and scanning function of Android apple native end


Project vision:


Let's work together to conquer the star sea and make good use of alien technology
